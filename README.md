##*Tech Used*
**Atom,css, HTML, Javascript **
##*Challenges*
**1)** **It was difficult initially when looking at the problem and knowing how  to approach the grid system.**

**2)** **Planning the initial logic behind the system was proving to be challenging especially trying to put the logic into coding.**

**3)** **Learn how to add colors to the grid, it has something to do with the clickmouse options , so i need to look into that more carefully** 

##*Takeaways*
**1)** **I feel a lot more confident compared to the first day of the javascript.I thoroughly enjoyed the task. Looking at the traversy videos about javascript and codeacademy tasks really help me understand the core basics which is vital. I need a lot more practice and make sure i approach the problem or task in a structured manor and not overcomplicate the matter.**
